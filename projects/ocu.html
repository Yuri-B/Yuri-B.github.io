            This was my thesis project during my studies in <a href="http://www.dit.ie/" target="_blank">Dublin Institute of Technology</a>. I have identified a problem to solve, conducted user research, evaluated user requirements and produced a working prototype.

          <h2 class="text-orange">Project Goal</h2>
          <h4>Create a payment system similar to <a href="https://intl.alipay.com/" target="_blank">AliPay</a> and <a href="https://pay.weixin.qq.com/index.php/public/wechatpay" target="_blank">WeChat Pay</a> and distribute it around stores in Greater Vancouver Area.</h4>
          <p>CheckPay's vision was to create a system to handle transactions between the shopper and retail clerk without the need for credit/debit cards. The shopper would pay the retail clerk by using a mobile app. This can enable lower transaction fees for the shopper, and at the same time introduce an opportunity for the retail store onwner to create multiple tipping and discount options.</p>

          <h3 class="text-purple">Initial Research</h3>
          <p>Canadian banking regulations were thoroughly researched. A decision was made to launch the business which was within the legal framework of <a href="http://www.fintrac-canafe.gc.ca/msb-esm/intro-eng.asp" target="_blank">Money Service Business</a>.</p>

          <h3 class="text-purple">Initial requirements ( <time datetime="2018">June 2017 - August 2017</time> )</h3>
          <p>The payment system needed to have separate terminals for shopper and retailer.</p>
          <p>Due to <b>extreme time constraint</b> of the project, the team has copied parts of AliPay and WeChat Pay features. The first version of the app was launched straight into production. It was built as a hybrid app with React and WeUI library, where I have collaborated with the team on implementing the first features within that app.</p>
          <p>First version was tested in August of 2017. It ran on Android platform.</p>

          <h3 class="text-purple">Design and Development</h3>
          <p>Design was loosely based on contemporary payment apps. A dark theme was used because the team agreed that it would be easier for the users to read payment information on a dark screen.</p>
          <p>The shopper app was launched on iOS and Android stores.</p>

          <h3 class="text-purple">Functionality</h3>
          <p>After extensive testing and more development, the app had the following functions :</p>

          <p class="emphasis">
            Enable shopper to pay in store<br />
            Enable retail owner to collect money from shopper<br />
            Enable basic tipping, refund and discount functions<br />
          </p>

          <p>The retailer app was launched in January 2018. It processed payments from AliPay and WeChat Pay users only. It used extensive amount of components which were purchased under license from third party developers. The app runs on <a href="https://sunmi.com/en/V1s/" target="_blank">SunMi</a> device, which is an Android phone that has additional NFC reader and receipt printer.</p>

        <h2>Project Outcome</h2>

        <p>After being nominated as a runner-up in an <a href="https://www.independent.ie/regionals/argus/news/louth-grads-shortlisted-for-digital-hub-contest-26955931.html" target="_blank">Irish digital media competition</a> , I have made an attempt to pitch it to a <a href="https://www.ndrc.ie/" target="_blank">start-up accelerator</a>. The pitch was not successful. However, one part of the project became standard features on many laptops : <b>screen which changes brightness depending on external lighting</b></p>
