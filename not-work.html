      <p>Good question. You can find out a summary of it on my LinkedIn profile here : <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/yuri-brigadir-07ba6422" target="_blank">My LinkedIn</a>. </p>

      <p>But what about pictures of projects and polished presentations of my <i>design process</i>? Sadly, that takes considerable amount of time (and money) to make, which I don't have. But that's not only my problem.</p>

      <p>People who work in technology and creative industries constantly have to promote themselves. They have to create personal websites with elaborate presentations, update their skills, polish their portfolios and their resumes. While they are all doing that, they have to pay for all kinds of bills, social media platforms and even web hosting costs. Nobody really <i>pays them</i> for all that work. Sometimes, all that work may not result in a paid job or a contract, which makes matters even worse.</p>
      <p>If we want to enable creative and skilled people to generate real progress, we have to give them more time and money for that, instead of forcing them to spend enormous amount of time and money just to talk about their work.</p>

      <p>I would rather spend my time on creating value. If I will succeed in creating value, other people will write about it. And if they will, I will credit them, put links of their writing here on my website and I will do my best to generate as much traffic for them as possible.</p>

      <p>You got it. My problem is every creative technologist's problem. So if you would like a solution for it, please contact me. </p>
